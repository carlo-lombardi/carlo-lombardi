Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carlo, and I am very happy that you stopped by here. We have cookies and some tea, and I hope you enjoy this introduction.

A little bit about me: I come from many places. I studied advertising for a year while working as a chef and running a pool business. I decided to move to Ireland to learn English and finish my degree. However, life had other plans, and I ended up working as a chef for three years while learning English.

I had some experience with programming when I was 15, where I learned HTML, a little CSS, and JavaScript. Unfortunately, I didn't continue with it in school.

One day, on my way home from work, I downloaded an application called Mimo (www.getmimo.com) and signed up for the Platzi Academy to learn Python. I found Strive School on Mimo, and it seemed like a promising boot camp to learn front-end and back-end programming.

I decided to immerse myself in it for eight months, and the experience was very enriching and exciting. After a lot of hard work, I completed the school with a project that I am very proud of, and you can see it here.

I am currently learning React Native, as I have seen the potential that React JS has for developing scalable web pages. One of my goals is to develop for mobile, and I have discovered the great opportunity that React Native provides for developing on Android and iOS platforms.

A little bit about me, I come from many places I studied advertising for a year, while working as a chef and running a pool business. 
I decided to move to Ireland to learn English and finish my degree, but as life turns around I ended up working as a chef for 3 years while learning English. 
I had experience in what is programming, I learned html, a little css and javascript at the age of 15 but I did not continue it at my school. 
One day while I was coming from work I downloaded an application called Mimo (www.getmimo.com) and I signed up for the Platzi academy to learn Python. 
On Mimo I found Strive school a promising bootcamp to learn to program in front-end and back-end. 
I decided to immerse myself in it for 8 months that the truth was that the experience was too enriching and excited, 
after a hard effort I finished school with a project that I am very proud of and you can see here.

Iâ€™m currently learning React Native, since I saw the potential that React JS has to develop web pages in a scalable way, and one of my goals is to develop for mobiles, I saw the great opportunity it has in React Native on android and iOS.
